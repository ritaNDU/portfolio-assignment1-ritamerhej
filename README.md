# My portfolio

## Description

This project is my portfolio.
It contains information about my experience, education.
I have actually done the first 3 projects. I am working on the Chip8 emulator. The others are out of pure imagination, just to add some content to the project's page.

## How to install

To install and run this project.

1. Clone the project using the following command:
   git clone https://github.com/ritaNDU/portfolio-assignment1-ritamerhej.git
2. Go inside the project and run yarn add
3. Run yarn dev and go to the specified link.

## Structure

All the code is stored into the src/ folder.
The code for the pages is stores inside the pages/ folder.
Each page is written into its own component.

Common components are stored in the components/ folder. Each component reprsents a feature inside a page. For example the NavBar component is the navbar that is present in all pages.

The data/ folder contains all the data for the about page and for the projects page.
Achievements are either related to education or work experience.
Projects are projects I have worked on. (Hint: They're not all real... ;P)
